# Excel_VBA-in-Finance
This contains some of the projects carried out during the Stochastic Methods for Finance course. 
In particular I want to share four projects that aroused my particular interest during the course: 
- Pricing with Different Models
- Simulation and Analysis of the Greeks
- Computation of the Implied Volatility 
- Simulation of the dynamics with Monte Carlo and Euler method

I share the paper that descibed with details the projects and also the EXCEL_VBA for the numerical results
